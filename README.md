# Liquid Background Effect

## Overview
This project is a web-based application that creates a liquid background effect by adding blurred blobs that bounce off the screen edge. It's a visually appealing and interactive way to enhance the user interface of a website.

## Features
- **Bouncing Blobs**: The application creates bouncing blobs of different colors that move around the screen.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
- **Interactive Experience**: The bouncing blobs provide an interactive and dynamic user experience.

## Getting Started
To start using the application:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Enjoy the liquid background effect!

## Usage
- **Viewing the Effect**: Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the effect.
- **Customization**: You can customize the colors, sizes, and speeds of the blobs by modifying the `script.js` file.

## Code Overview
The main logic of the application is contained in the `script.js` file. It defines a `Blob` class that represents a single blob. Each blob has properties such as size, speed, and position, and methods to update its position and move it on the screen. The `initBlobs` function initializes the blobs and updates their positions in an animation loop.
